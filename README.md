# Go REST API

This program simulates a driver-sharing app like many famous apps through a REST API using [Go](https://golang.org) and [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin).

An adaptation of the examples from the book [APIs REST by Alexandre Saudate](https://www.casadocodigo.com.br/products/livro-apis-rest).
